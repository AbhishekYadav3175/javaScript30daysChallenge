// Day 4: Loops
// Tasks/Activities
    // Activity 1: For Loop
        // Task 1: WAP to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
        // Task 2: WAP to print the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.

    // Activity 2: While Loop
        // Task 3: WAP to calculate the sun of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
        // Task 4: WAP to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

    // Activity 3: Do...While Loop
        // Task 5: WAP to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do...while loop.
        // Task 6: WAP to calculate the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

    // Activity 4: Nested Loops
        // Task 7: WAP to print a pattern using nested for loops:
                // *
                // * *
                // * * *
                // * * * *
    
    // Activity 5: Loop Control Statements
        // Task 8: WAP to print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip the number 5 using the continue statement.
        // Task 9: WAP to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop when the number is 7 using the break statement.

// Feature Request:
    // 1. Number Printing Script: Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop and a while loop.
    // 2. Multiplication Table Script: Create a script that prints the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.
    // 3. Patteern Printing Script: Write a script that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops.
    // 4. Sum Calculation Script: Write a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
    // 5. Factorial Calculation Script: Create a script that calculates the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

// Achievement:
    // By the end of these activities, students will:
        // Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
        // Utilize while looops for iteration based on a condition.
        // Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
        // Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
        // Use loop control statements(break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
