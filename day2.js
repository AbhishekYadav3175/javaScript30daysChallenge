// Day 2: Operators
// Tasks/Activities
let num1 = 10
let num2 = 20
// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
    // Task 1: WAP to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
    console.log("Addition:",num1+num2)
    // Task 2: WAP to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
    console.log("Subtraction:",num1-num2)
    // Task 3: WAP to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
    console.log("Multiplication:",num1*num2)
    // Task 4: WAP to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
    console.log("Division:",num1/num2)
    // Task 5: WAP to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to console.
    console.log("Remainder:",num1%num2)


// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
    // Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
    num1 += 2
    console.log(num1)
    // Task 7: Use the -= operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
    num2 -= 2
    console.log(num2)

// Activity 3: Comparsion Operators
    // Task 8: WAP to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
    console.log(num1>num2)
    console.log(num1<num2)
    // Task 9: WAP to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
    console.log(num1>=num2)
    console.log(num1<=num2)
    // Task 10: WAP to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
    console.log(num1==num2)
    console.log(num1===num2)        // strict type check

// Activity 4: Logical Operators
    // Task 11: WAP that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
    console.log(num1&&num2)
    // Task 12: WAP that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
    console.log(num1||num2)
    // Task 13: WAP that uses the ! operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
    console.log(!num1)
    console.log(!num2)

// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
    // WAP that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is psitive or negative and log the result to the console.
    let isPositive = (num1>0) ? true : false
    if(isPositive){
        console.log("Positive Number")
    }else{
        console.log("Negative Number")
    }
// Feature Request:
    // 1.Arithmetic Operations Script: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
    // 2.Comparison and Logical Operators Script: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
    // 3.Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

// Achievement:
    // By the end of these activities, students will:
        // Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
        // Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
        // Compare values using comparison operators.
        // Combine conditions using logical operators.
        // Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
